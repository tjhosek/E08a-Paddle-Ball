A skeleton for a breakout game, in which a ball bounces around the sides of the screen and a paddle which is controlled by the mouse. One thing that was challenging was locating the viewport, but by changing the border of it to a brighter blue, it became much easier to see. I may make it green to increase visibility even more.
